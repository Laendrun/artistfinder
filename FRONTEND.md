# Artistfinder - Frontend

## To-do

- [ ] Full front-end refactor

- [ ] Take care of 404 errors 'cause the error message is disgusting for now
  - [ ] Create a "404 - Not found" page with a link to the homepage

## Frontend

- Part of the website that the user directly interacts with.
- Includes styling, graphics, text, alignment, navigation, colors, etc
- Responsiveness and performance are two main objectives of the Frontend

### Framework choice

[Angular VS React VS Vue](https://youtu.be/PCgM44dSTsk)

- ReactJS (Heard a lot about it, maybe I'll try to use it.)
  - Responsible for the view layer of the application
  - React users a virtual DOM to fill in data in the HTML DOM
  - Consists of multiple component that output a small piece of HTML
  - Users a domain specific language called JSX
    - JSX : Hybrid between JS and HTML
  - Interesting video > [Video](https://youtu.be/LwU798HJIrZ)
- AngularJS (Heard a lot of about it but mostly for Single Page Apps)
  - Primarily aimed to develop Single Page Applications
  - It is completely written in TypeScript
  - It uses HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly
  - It is designed for web, desktop and mobile platform
- VueJS (Already seen some things about Vue, not sure if it will be the framework I need)
  - Used to develop user intefaces and single page applications
  - Vue is focused on the view and model layer of the MVC framework
  - Vue uses reactive two-way data binding
  - Vue uses virtual DOM as an adopted concept of React
- EmberJS (Never heard of it before...)
  - Ember apps come with a built-in environment with fast rebuilds, auto-reload and a test runner
  - The routes are core features of the EmberJS which are used for managing the URLs
  - Ember Data allows you to access data across multiple sources at once
  - Every time an entity is generated in an Ember app, tests are also generated for that same entity
  - Ember is built on Glimmer Rendering
