# Artistfinder

Let's discover **Artistfinder**.

## What is Artistfinder

We found that it's really easy for a musician, particularly DJs to find a gig online.

There's already plenty of platform for that.

> So why build yet another one ?

Our goal is to make a platform where every artist can find a gig.

Whether you're a musician, a photograph, a painter, we want you to be able to share your work as easily as possible.

We don't want these kind of platform to be available only to DJs.

## How did it start ?

I (Simon) received a message from an old work colleague asking me if I could help him on a project.

I asked to know more, he sent an email explaining the project in further detail, and here we are.
